# NTT - A framework for working with TTCN-3 

This project aims to provide tools and libraries for working with
[TTCN-3][etsi-homepage] (Testing and Test Control Notation Version 3). TTCN-3 is
a standardized test specification language that applies to a variety of
application domains and types of testing. It has been used since 2000 in
standardization as well as in industry, research, international projects and
academia. Unfortunately tool support for TTCN-3 is quite antiquated.

Please note, that NTT is still in its early stages. Documentation and
functionality will grow over time. If you are interested in contributing, just
create a pull-request.
